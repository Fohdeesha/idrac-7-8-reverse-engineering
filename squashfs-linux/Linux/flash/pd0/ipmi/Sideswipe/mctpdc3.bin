; sys
; defines the number of pci slots in the system and the number of muxes in the system
; Format:
; sys=number_of_pci_slots,number_of_muxes,startup_delay_ms
sys=12,3,FFFF

; mux
; defines each mux in the system. There should be one such line per mux in the system
; Format:
; mux=bus_num,num_ch,s0_gpio,s1_spio,ch0_pci,ch1_pci,ch2_pci,ch3_pci
;
; bus_num:	I2C BUS to which the mux is connected to
; num_ch:	Number of channels on the mux (currently max is 4)
; s0_gpio:	gpio assigned to S0 pin for swtiching the mux (in Hex)
; s1_gpio:	gpio assigned to S1 pin for switching the mux (in Hex)
; ch0_pci:	PCI Slot number of the slot connected to channel 0 of mux -1 means no connection
; ch1_pci:	PCI Slot number of the slot connected to channel 1 of mux -1 means no connection
; ch2_pci:	PCI Slot number of the slot connected to channel 2 of mux -1 means no connection
; ch3_pci:	PCI Slot number of the slot connected to channel 3 of mux -1 means no connection

; Slot number is split as follows
; 5 least significant bits represent a unique number (id) (1 based)
; 3 msb (bits 5,6,7) represents the type as follows:
; 000 = normal PCIe slot - the id represents the slot id as shown on the silk screen
; 001 = PERC Mini -  5 lsbs represents an unique id of the controller (if more than 1)
; 010 = NDC - 5 lsbs represent an unique id if there are more than 1
; 011 = Mezz card - 5 lsb represent (1 = mezz A, 2 = mezz b and so on)
; 101 = special riser(Butterfly Riser) card which supports i2cmux on sideswipe
; All other types are reserved for future use
; Example: 0x01 = PCIe slot 1 | 0x21 = First PERC Mini | 0x41 = First NDC

; sa
; List of slave addresses in the following format
; {slaveaddress:devicetype:speed}
; slaveaddress:		is the slave address in hex
; devicetype:		1=Storage, 2=NCSI, 3=FRU, 4=SENSOR, A=12GbpsHBA
; speed:		I2C speed of the device (in hex 190=400Khz | 64=100Khz)
