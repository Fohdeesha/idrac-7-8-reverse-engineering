# Updated: 2016-03-17
# Added/updated descriptions for PECI completion codes to those for Skylake CPU. The descriptions are backward compatible to older-gen CPUs. The descriptions are distilled from Tables 67 & 69 in Skylake EDS Vol1.
# Added the PECI Proxy completion codes to the "generic" section in throttlem.txt with "(PECI proxy)" prefix.
# Added newer completion codes for the commands used by throttle.sh as per SPS 3.0 and 4.0 EIS spec.  So, file is now current for 14G.

# Updated: 2013-09-12
# document version: 1.00.10 Only be used by throttle.sh v2.0 and later.
# This is a description information table which contains completioncodes/status/bitfields/certain-messages for easy human-reading.

# -[HowTo]-
# For examples:
# Completion code 0x81 for return by NetFun=0x2F, Command=0xd9
# >grep "^2E:42:CP:AC" -m 1 throttlem.txt | cut -d '=' -f 2
# anchoring the keyword at the beginning of a line
# The result on screen will display with "CPU not present."

# CompletionCode in default usage
CP:6F=Access denied. iDRAC Enterprise License required.
CP:7E=(iDRAC-specific) Pending.
CP:A0=(PECI Proxy) Partial success. Partial response provided. Response exceeds max IPMI message size for NM IPMI 41h command (Aggregated Send RAW PECI).
CP:A1=(PECI Proxy) Wrong CPU number.
CP:A2=(PECI Proxy) Command response timeout. Retry may be needed.
CP:A4=(PECI Proxy) Bad read FCS (frame check sequence) in the response (even after retry). Most likely cause is incorrect requested read length.
CP:A5=(PECI Proxy) Bad write FCS (frame check sequence) field in the response or Abort FCS in the response (even after retry). Most likely cause is incorrect requested write length.
CP:A6=(PECI Proxy) Wrong (unsupported) write length in IPMI request.
CP:A7=(PECI Proxy) Wrong (unsupported) read length in IPMI request.
CP:A8=(PECI Proxy) Selected PECI interface not available. Not configured by BIOS (for in-band PECI), not functional (for in-band PECI or serial PECI), or not connected (for serial PECI, disabled using OEM configuration option).
CP:AB=(PECI Proxy) Wrong (unknown/invalid/illegal) command code. Request not understood by CPU.
CP:AC=(PECI Proxy) CPU not present. No response from PECI client.
CP:C0=Node Busy. Command could not be processed because command processing resources are temporarily unavailable.
CP:C1=Invalid Command. Used to indicate an unrecognized or unsupported command.
CP:C2=Command invalid for given LUN.
CP:C3=Timeout while processing command. Response unavailable.
CP:C4=Out of space. Command could not be completed because of a lack of storage space required to execute the given command operation.
CP:C5=Reservation Canceled or Invalid Reservation ID.
CP:C6=Request data truncated.  Check requested data length.
CP:C7=Request data length invalid.
CP:C8=Request data field length limit exceeded.
CP:C9=Parameter out of range. One or more parameters in the data field of the Request are out of range. This is different from 'Invalid data field' (CCh) code in that it indicates that the erroneous field(s) has a contiguous range of possible values.
CP:CA=Cannot return number of requested data bytes.
CP:CB=Requested Sensor, data, or record not present.
CP:CC=Invalid data field in Request
CP:CD=Command illegal for specified sensor or record type.
CP:CE=Command response could not be provided.
CP:CF=Cannot execute duplicated request. This completion code is for devices which cannot return the response that was returned for the original instance of the request.
CP:D0=Command response could not be provided. SDR Repository in update mode.
CP:D1=Command response could not be provided. Device in firmware update mode.
CP:D2=Command response could not be provided. BMC initialization or initialization agent in progress.
CP:D3=Destination unavailable. Cannot deliver request to selected destination.
CP:D4=Cannot execute command due to insufficient privilege level or other security-based restriction.
CP:D5=Cannot execute command. Command, or request parameter(s), not supported in present state or mode. CPU power management may be a HWP-based mode.  If command is a PECI Proxy command, platform not in S0/S1 state.
CP:D6=Cannot execute command. Parameter is illegal because command sub-function has been disabled or is unavailable. Check whether iDRAC is in manufacturing mode. May need iDRAC to reboot into manufacturing mode with the MFG Mode Jumper installed to succeed.
CP:DF=Resource busy within iDRAC. Retry is appropriate.
CP:FF=Unspecified error.
