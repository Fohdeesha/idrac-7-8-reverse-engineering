# These files are considered legacy and are unnecessary on legacy-free
# systems. /run/lock/subsys is used for serializing SysV service
# execution, and hence without use on SysV-less systems.
#
# /run/lock/lockdev is used to serialize access to tty devices via
# LCK..xxx style lock files, For more information see:
# http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2011-March/001823.html
# On modern systems a BSD file lock is a better choice if
# serialization is needed on those devices.
